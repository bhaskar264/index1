<p1>A curriculum vitae, often abbreviated as CV, is a document that job
 applicants use to sh
wcase their academic and professional accomplishments.
 It is used to apply for positions within areas where a person’s specific knowledge or expertise 
is required.
 A curriculum vitae is usually longer than a resume and must include the 
information that the recruiter needsWWW
 to verify the skills, experience, and educational qualifications of
 an applicant.In many countries, a CV is
 usually the first document that a prospective employer looks at when screening candidates for job interviews,
 scholarship programs, grant applications, or bursaries.
 When sending a curriculum vitae and other application documents to the employer, 
some applicants may choose to send physical copies of the document through 
registered mail, or electronically through email,
depending on what the prospective employer indicated on the job advertisement.The information included in the CV may vary from one applicant
 to another, since some applicants may choose to include only the information that is relevant to the job they are applying for.
 The following are the typical components of a curriculum vitae:

At the top of the curriculum vitae, write your full name and conta
ct information such as phone number, email address, registered mail address, etc.
Education information includes a list of the education programs you pursued and the years and name of the institution you attended.
 Ideally, you should include information on college, graduate school, and post-graduate schools you attended, the courses you pursued, 
and the year when you graduated from the program.

Some employers may also require you to indicate the grades/awards you obtained at various education levels. Employers use the education informatio
n to determine if your
 professional qualifications match the job requirements of the position you are applying for.

The work experience section requires you to list your recent work experience that is relevant to the position you are applying for. For each position you’ve previously held,
 indicate the name of the employer (company), your specific roles, and the duration of the employment.

Also, make sure to give a summary of the duties you performed at each company and any accomplishments/awards given by the employer. 
List the relevant work experience starting from the most recent positions you held.If you possess certain skills and you have not
 mentioned them in the other sections in the curriculum vitae,
 list them here.
 The skills may include language skills, computer skills, driving skills, advanced software skills, etc. 
They should be relevant to the job you are applying for.
